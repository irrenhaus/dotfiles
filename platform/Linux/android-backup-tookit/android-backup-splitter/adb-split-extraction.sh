# Name: ADB Backup Splitter (extraction method)
# Author: dragomerlin
# License: GPL v3
#
###############################################################
#
# NOTES:
# - it is recommended to use the non extraction method instead
# - java 7 or higher is required due to SYNC_FLUSH mode for the Deflater
#
# Description:
#
# This bash script utility generates an adb backup for each item
# on apps/ folder (not recursively). That equals to generating an adb backup
# for each app.
#
# shared/0 and shared/1 (sdcards) are ignored, so that means that
# external data and OBB files, although should be backed up, may not
# be restored. For doing so, backup the folder Android of the sdcards.
# 
# Creating a backup with -shared flag has known issues (corruption),
# so is not recommended. Use the flag -noshared
#
# Sometimes, using the flag -nocompress can help when this errors happen on logcat:

# Corrupt tar archive in this case:

#
# This script works on Cygwin also, and in general where star does.
#
# There may be adb backups which don't include the apk inside. In that
# particular case, you need to install the apk first on the device so the
# adb restore restores the data for your app. Installing the apk afterwards won't work.
# There is generated an html file called apk-missing.html so you can open it and
# install all applications from Play Store on any of your devices. For apps
# downloaded outside Play Store is up to you to back up them before erasing
# the device. In any case it's a good idea to always back up apk's since sometimes
# applications are removed from the store. Titanium Backup, Clockworkmod and
# TWRP are great for that.
# 
# Changelog:
# 19 may 2018
# - Removed detection of java version, because version numbering has different formats now
#	See "example-java-versions.txt" and "OpenJDK-JEP-223.html" for details
# 02 february 2018
# - "Android Backup Splitter" renamed to "android-backup-splitter"
# - Updated JAVA_VER detection to work with both Oracle java and OpenJDK java
# - Updated JAVA_VER to prevent %0D from adding to bash variable
# - Added detection of corrupt tar file before attempting to extract it
# 11 october 2015
# - Replace sh with bash to prevent issues
# - Bugfix: Add quotation marks sourrounding most $ variables. In case there are spaces to keep it working
#	Probably it's not completely right but should work for standard use
# - adb-split.sh renamed to adb-split_extraction.sh
# 18 august 2015
# - Added patch from Andreas Stern: those files with 2 or more backslashes in
#	the filename, replace them with a single one when generating app-list/ files.
#	This allows star to work on OS X when compressing. I will not work on Cygwin,
#	which will use backslash as directory separator instead. star will use exit code
#	different from 0 on this case. Check with 'echo $?' to detect this.
#	Also use $apk_cnt and $apk_miss_cnt
# - $SCRIPT_DIR set to relative value "." so it works with
#	Cygwin. Using absolute unix path doesn't work with java on
#	Windows, the path has to be converted to dos path first if used.
#	For example 'cygpath.exe -m ${SCRIPT_DIR}/'
