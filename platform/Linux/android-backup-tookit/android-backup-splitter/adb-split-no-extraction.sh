# Name: ADB Backup Splitter (non extraction method)

#
# NOTES:
# - this is the recommended method (doesn't extract tar contents)
# - java 7 or higher is required due to SYNC_FLUSH mode for the Deflater
#
# Description:
#
# This bash script utility reads an adb backup, and for each android app or sdcard (shared) inside,
# creates a single backup of its own into a folder. So basically is useful for
# splitting one big unmanageable file into little ones, so you can store or restore android apps 
# or sdcards individually. Because, as we know, adb restore does not allow for any kind of selection
# at restore time, it just does all at once.
# The resulting ab(s) go into the split-android/. This script works on Cygwin also. Should work on OS X too.
# The goodness of this method is that thanks to the capabilities of
# tar-binary-splitter it splits a tar archive without actually extracting
# the contents to the hard drive and then re-archiving. Thus there's no issue
# even if there are incompatible characters in the filename or path.
# This is the recommended method for splitting an adb backup.
#
# Creating a backup with -shared flag has known issues (corruption),
# so is not recommended. Use the flag -noshared
#
# Sometimes, using the flag -nocompress can help when this errors happen on logcat:

# There may be adb backups which don't include the apk inside. In that
# particular case, you need to install the apk first on the device, so the
# adb restore restores the data for your app. Installing the apk afterwards won't work.
# There is generated an html file called apk-missing.html so you can open it and
# install all applications from Play Store on any of your devices. For apps
# downloaded outside Play Store is up to you to back up them before erasing
# the device. In any case it's a good idea to always back up apk's since sometimes
# applications are removed from the store. Titanium Backup, Clockworkmod and
# TWRP are great for that.
# 
# Changelog:
# 19 may 2018
# - Removed detection of java version, because version numbering has different formats now
#	See "example-java-versions.txt" and "OpenJDK-JEP-223.html" for details
# 02 february 2018
# - "Android Backup Splitter" renamed to "android-backup-splitter"
# - Updated JAVA_VER detection to work with both Oracle java and OpenJDK java
# - Updated JAVA_VER to prevent %0D from adding to bash variable
# - Added detection of corrupt tar file before attempting to split it
# 12 october 2015
# - Use Tar Binary Splitter to avoid having to extract the main tar
# - Replace sh with bash to prevent issues
# - Replace app-ab with split-ab because now shared is included
# - Replace app-tar with split-android
# - Bugfix: Add quotation marks sourrounding most $ variables. In case there are spaces to keep it working
#	Probably it's not completely right but should work for standard use
# - Ignore checking for apk in shared
# - Use $apk_cnt, $apk_miss_cnt and $shared_cnt to notify
# - $SCRIPT_DIR set to relative value "." so it works with
#	Cygwin. Using absolute unix path doesn't work with java on
#	Windows, the path has to be converted to dos path first if used.
#	For example 'cygpath.exe -m "${SCRIPT_DIR}"/'
